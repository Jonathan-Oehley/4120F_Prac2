\section{Introduction}
Things to still deal with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item add something about rgb 
	\item explain median filter before talking about edge case pixels
	\item check language against Keegan's Prac1 feedback
\end{itemize}
A Median Filter is a filtering method often used in image and signal processing. On a 2-dimensional image problem, each output pixel is the median of the surrounding n x n pixels.

This investigation will implement a 9x9 median filter.
