A Median Filter is a filtering method often used in image and signal processing. On a 2-dimensional image problem, each colour component of the output pixel is the median of the surrounding n x n pixel colour components. Such a filter is often implemented to reduce speckle or salt-and-pepper noise in images\cite{NSP}.

This investigation will implement a 9x9 median filter.
