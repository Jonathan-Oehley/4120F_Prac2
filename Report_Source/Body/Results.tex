\section{Results}

All values of execution times are averages of at least 3 different measurements. The Speedup is calculated as the baseline (either the Golden Measure or Bubble Sort) divided by the new speed achieved. Speedup can be read as the compared value is Speedup times faster than the baseline.

\subsection{Sorting Algorithms}

The first comparison drawn was the difference in executing times of the median filter using different sorting functions. The results found are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:SAC}.

\Table{Sorting Algorithm Comparisons\label{tab:SAC}}{lccr}{ 
	\textbf{} & \textbf{Bubble} & \textbf{Select} & \textbf{std::sort} 
}{
	Fly.jpg (s) & 25.23 & 7.75 & 4.66 \\
	Alan.jpg (s) & 9.43 & 3.76 & 1.95 \\
	Average (s) & 17.33 & 5.75 & 3.30 \\
	Speed-up & 1.00 & 3.01 & 5.25 \\
}{Example}

The Select sort was significantly more efficient and the ability to stop halfway through sorting to get the median sped it up a lot but the select algorithm itself isn't particularly efficient so that slows it down.
The std::sort method inbuilt to c++ is a hybrid function using much more efficient algorithms and therefore it is the fastest and was used in the final measurement for the multi-threaded implementation. 

\subsection{Thread count investigation}

\subsection{Implementation comparison}

The execution time for the Golden Measure and the Multi-threaded implementations were compared in Table~\ref{tab:GMvMT}. This Speedup fluctuated with different image sizes. This is likely due to many factors interacting simultaneously and would require further investigation to isolate the cause. But the Speedup is approximately 30 times on average across image sizes.
