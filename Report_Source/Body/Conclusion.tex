\section{Conclusion}
It was found in this report that the use of data partitioning and multithreading when implementing a 9 x 9 median filter for an image significantly reduces the execution time of the application. On average a speed-up of 29.74 was found when implementing a multi-threaded implementation compared with a serial one. The investigation into which sorting algorithm was faster for use in a median filter concluded that a Qsort was the most suitable. Finally, it was found that the speed-up of the implemented filter increased with thread-count up until a certain critical point where speed-up starts to decrease with an increasing number of threads.

The relationship between speed-up and image size was determined to be more complex than a simple linear relationship, indicating that there are multiple factors involved. This could be investigated further in future reports.

The images shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:Output} show the input jpeg images on the left and the filtered outputs on the right. These are examples of the working median filter implemented.
